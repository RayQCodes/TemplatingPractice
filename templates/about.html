    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      In the past, I have worked with many companies and on various roles such
      as Cyber Security related roles, iOS developer, Tech consultant, Backend
      Developer, Content Creator, CTO, and these days, I am at a full-time job
      as Senior Director at PW (Physics Wallah). I have done my fair share of
      startups too. My last startup was LearnCodeOnline where we served 350,000+
      users with various courses, and the best part was that we were able to
      offer these courses at pricing of 299- 399 INR â€” crazy right ðŸ˜±? But that
      chapter of life is over and I am no longer in charge of that platform. I
      think we have already complicated the frontend too much, so I am opting
      for a simpler solution for my home page â€” and this is one of the fastest
      web pages on the internet.
